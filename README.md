# 2407.12118
Datasets for Exploring Top-Quark Signatures of Heavy Flavor-Violating Scalars at the LHC

The .csv files are the simulated events used in the analysis presented in 2407.12118. The flavon masses were simulated in the range 200-1400 GeV. There are also five different types of backgrounds. All events in these files passed the selection criteria explained in the paper for two kinds of final state signatures: same-sign (SS) and opposite-sign (OS) leptons.
